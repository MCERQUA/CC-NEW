Living in Santa Valley, AZ means your air conditioner works overtime during our hot summers. Regular maintenance is crucial to keep your AC running efficiently and avoid costly breakdowns when you need cooling the most.

## 1. Change Your Air Filter Monthly

This is the simplest yet most important maintenance task:
- **Why it matters**: Dirty filters restrict airflow, making your system work harder
- **Cost savings**: Clean filters can reduce energy consumption by 5-15%
- **Pro tip**: Set a monthly reminder on your phone
- **Filter types**: Use MERV 8-11 filters for best balance of filtration and airflow

## 2. Keep Your Outdoor Unit Clear

Your AC's condenser unit needs breathing room:
- Remove debris, leaves, and vegetation within 2 feet
- Trim bushes and plants regularly
- Never stack items against the unit
- Gently rinse with a garden hose monthly (turn power off first!)

## 3. Check and Clean Condensate Drain Line

A clogged drain line can cause water damage and system shutdown:
- **Location**: Usually a PVC pipe near your indoor unit
- **Cleaning method**: Pour 1 cup of vinegar down the line quarterly
- **Warning signs**: Water around indoor unit or musty odors
- **Prevention**: Install a safety float switch

## 4. Inspect Refrigerant Lines

The copper lines running from your outdoor to indoor unit:
- Look for damaged or missing insulation
- Check for ice formation (indicates low refrigerant)
- Ensure lines are properly supported
- Call a professional if you notice oil stains (refrigerant leak)

## 5. Schedule Professional Maintenance

While DIY maintenance helps, annual professional service is essential:
- **Spring timing**: Schedule before the hot season
- **What's included**: 
  - Refrigerant level check
  - Electrical component inspection
  - Coil cleaning
  - System performance test
- **Benefits**: Maintains warranty, catches problems early
